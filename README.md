# Popular Drama List

This is a personal project, done for learning JS. 
#### Steps:
 - Make a HTML template. Add sections for header, main-listing and pagination. Used Bootstrap for most css
 - Start with the Js file. Code for previous, next pages. 
 - Wrote the functions for collection of data, and parse it to get image cover, title, ratings, link and made the elements via JS. Finally added them in the HTML file.
 
 

I made the Python file, "parser.py", to parse the webpage but am not using it. [Just for fun!]
##
#### Note:
- You might get error on inspecting the webpage in the Console Section like "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'url' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

To resolve this, just add a CORS extension from Chrome WebStore, switch it ON and you are good to go.

- After cloning the Repos, open the "index.html" in the browser, and copy the url in the file "parse.js", in the variable base_url.
